# Awareness

Awareness **scans** long recordings of football matches with custom-trained computer vision models by Roboflow, with lofty aims to democratize (_costly_) data to resource-scarce competitions and teams, in the world of football analytics.

üí° Key highlights

- Tracks + annotates players, ball, goalkeepers and referees
- Spatiotemporal analysis, in the lite form of Pitch Control
- (_WIP_) Visualization app to tweak tactical structure with Pitch Control effects
